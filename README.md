# Phaser Demo Game
A simple web game built with [Phaser](https://phaser.io/) to explore and experiment with 2D game development for the web.

In this game, the player controls a platform that can be moved left and right using arrow keys or mouse movement on desktop or by sliding a finger on mobile devices. The objective is to "catch" a bouncing SpongeBob character, allowing it to bounce off the platform. Each successful bounce scores a point.

# How to run locally
The setup uses [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/), so as a prerequisite, you'll need to install it by following the [link](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/).

OnceDocker Compose is installed, you can build and start the game containers by running:

``` docker-compose up --build ```
